# MongoDB $in operator with empty array

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` will return an empty array, regardless of whether the `field` has any values or is null/undefined. This is because the `$in` operator requires at least one value to match against.

## Solution
To handle this correctly, you can either:

1. Check if the array is empty before executing the query.
2. Use a different operator such as `$exists` if you are interested in checking whether the field is present in the document.

The provided solution demonstrates these approaches.
